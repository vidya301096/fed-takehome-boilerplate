# designory. Front End Developer - Take Home Test Boilerplate

Convert the attached PDF comp - [**Designory-Project.pdf**](Designory-Project.pdf) - to a webpage using the
following guidelines:

*  Give a detailed explanation of why you coded it the way you did
*  No CSS frameworks
*  Please use a CSS pre-processor (ie, Sass/SCSS)
*  Please make responsive as best you can, mobile first
*  ZIP the resulting HTML, CSS, and JS files (where applied) when sending the finished product. If using this boilerplate, running `npm run build` will generate this ZIP file for you.

## What is this Boilerplate?

This is a sample [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) project that has already been configured to give you
Sass compilation, Babel transpilation, and browser hot-reloads out of the box.

Creating this page within this (or any) Node environment is not required. If you already have a local
development environment that you prefer, you can use that instead.

## Installation Instructions

> Installing this boilerplate assumes you already have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and
> [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed and configured on your machine.

Install all npm modules via:

    npm ci
    # alternatively,
    # npm install
    
Then simply run `npm run dev` to start developing!

_IMPORTANT_:  
Save all of your work within the **src/** folder. The **dist/** folder is ignored from the repository.

### Libraries

Uses the following libraries:

*  [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) - SCSS compilation.
*  [babel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel) - JavaScript ESNext to ES5 compilation.
*  [cpx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cpx) - Copies source HTML file to **dist/** directory.
*  [Browersersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) - Development server with live-reloading.
*  [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) - Enables all build scripts (`styles`, `scripts`, `views`, `serve`) to be run at the same time.
